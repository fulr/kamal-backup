## Generate The Backup Config

Run:

```sh
bundle exec kamal-backup init
```

`init` creates `config/kamal-backup.yml` if it is missing, then prints the accessory block to add to `config/deploy.yml`. It does not edit `config/deploy.yml`, and it does not create `config/kamal-backup.local.yml`.

The generated backup config looks like this:

```yaml
accessory: backup
app_name: your-app
database_adapter: postgres
database_url: postgres://your-app@your-db:5432/your_app_production
backup_paths:
  - /data/storage
restic_repository: s3:https://s3.example.com/your-app-backups
restic_init_if_missing: true
backup_schedule_seconds: 86400
```
{: data-title="config/kamal-backup.yml"}

Edit that file for production. It is the main backup configuration: app name, database source, restic repository, file paths, and schedule.

## Default Options

- `accessory`: the Kamal accessory name. The default is `backup`.
- `app_name`: the app tag used on restic snapshots.
- `database_adapter`: `postgres`, `mysql`, or `sqlite`.
- `database_url`: the production database connection string. PostgreSQL can also use libpq variables such as `PGHOST`, `PGDATABASE`, and `PGUSER`; MySQL can use `MYSQL_*` or `MARIADB_*` variables.
- `backup_paths`: file-backed Active Storage paths to snapshot from mounted volumes.
- `restic_repository`: the restic repository location, such as S3-compatible storage, a restic REST server, or a filesystem path.
- `restic_init_if_missing`: run `restic init` when the repository has not been initialized yet.
- `backup_schedule_seconds`: how often the accessory runs backups. `86400` means once per day.

For MySQL, change the database settings:

```yaml
database_adapter: mysql
database_url: mysql2://app@app-mysql:3306/app_production
```
{: data-title="config/kamal-backup.yml"}

For SQLite, point at the database file inside the accessory:

```yaml
database_adapter: sqlite
sqlite_database_path: /data/db/production.sqlite3
```
{: data-title="config/kamal-backup.yml"}

## Add The Accessory

Copy the accessory block printed by `init` into your Kamal deploy config, then mount the generated backup config with `files:`.

```yaml
accessories:
  backup:
    image: ghcr.io/crmne/kamal-backup:latest
    host: chatwithwork.com
    files:
      - config/kamal-backup.yml:/app/config/kamal-backup.yml:ro
    env:
      secret:
        - PGPASSWORD
        - RESTIC_PASSWORD
        - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    volumes:
      - "chatwithwork_storage:/data/storage:ro"
      - "chatwithwork_backup_state:/var/lib/kamal-backup"
```
{: data-title="config/deploy.yml"}

The `files:` line is what keeps non-secret backup settings out of environment variables. Kamal uploads `config/kamal-backup.yml` and mounts it read-only into the accessory.

## Secrets

Keep secrets in Kamal secrets:

```sh
RESTIC_PASSWORD=...
PGPASSWORD=...
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

If the repository URL contains credentials, keep `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` in Kamal secrets and omit `restic_repository` from YAML.

If you do not want the restic password value in the process environment, point restic at a mounted file instead:

```yaml
restic_password_file: /run/secrets/restic-password
```
{: data-title="config/kamal-backup.yml"}

The same works for the repository string when needed:

```yaml
restic_repository_file: /run/secrets/restic-repository
```
{: data-title="config/kamal-backup.yml"}

## Validate Before Boot

Run this before booting or rebooting the accessory:

```sh
bundle exec kamal-backup validate
```

With a normal `config/deploy.yml`, `validate` checks the backup accessory config before the accessory has to be running. It catches missing app, database, restic, backup path settings, and required Kamal secrets that resolve to empty values.

## Local Restores

For normal Rails apps, no local backup config is needed. `restore local` and `drill local` infer:

- production source settings from `config/kamal-backup.yml`
- local database settings from `config/database.yml`
- local Active Storage path from `storage`
- local state under `tmp/kamal-backup`

Only add `config/kamal-backup.local.yml` when your local targets are nonstandard:

```yaml
database_url: postgres://localhost/chatwithwork_development
backup_paths:
  - storage
state_dir: tmp/kamal-backup
```
{: data-title="config/kamal-backup.local.yml"}

## Useful Options

These options are supported but not included in the generated default config:

```yaml
restic_check_after_backup: true
restic_check_read_data_subset: 5%
restic_forget_after_backup: true
restic_keep_last: 7
restic_keep_daily: 7
restic_keep_weekly: 4
restic_keep_monthly: 6
restic_keep_yearly: 2
backup_start_delay_seconds: 0
```
{: data-title="config/kamal-backup.yml"}

Environment variables can still override YAML values when you need an emergency override, but the clean setup is YAML for configuration and Kamal secrets for secrets.
