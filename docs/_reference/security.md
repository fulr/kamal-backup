## Secrets

`kamal-backup` redacts secrets in evidence and command failure output. It treats values from keys containing words such as `password`, `secret`, `token`, `key`, and `credential` as sensitive.

Do not put cloud credentials in clear Kamal environment. Use Kamal secrets for:

- `RESTIC_PASSWORD`;
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`;
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`;
- database passwords such as `PGPASSWORD` and `MYSQL_PWD`.

## Subprocess execution

External tools are executed with argument arrays, not shell interpolation. The backup container does not need application source code.

## Database backups

Database backups use database-native export tools:

- PostgreSQL: `pg_dump --format=custom --no-owner --no-privileges`
- MySQL/MariaDB: `mariadb-dump` or `mysqldump` with transaction-safe defaults
- SQLite: `sqlite3 <db> ".backup ..."`

This is why the docs talk about database backups rather than raw database directories. `kamal-backup` is exporting application data with the tools Rails teams already use for dumps and restores.

## Active Storage backups

File-backed Active Storage files are backed up from configured mounted paths with `restic backup`. In a Kamal accessory, mount the production storage volume read-only when possible so the backup container can read Active Storage files without being able to modify them.

## Deliberate restores

Restore commands are explicit and deliberate:

- operators must choose `restore local`, `restore production`, `drill local`, or `drill production`
- destructive restore commands prompt for confirmation unless `--yes` is passed
- local restores refuse production-looking local targets unless `KAMAL_BACKUP_ALLOW_PRODUCTION_RESTORE=true`
- production drills restore into scratch targets, not the live production database
- production-side commands can be run from the local gem with `-d` or `-c`, but the destructive work still happens on the backup accessory with the same explicit command surface

Production-looking targets are refused unless `KAMAL_BACKUP_ALLOW_PRODUCTION_RESTORE=true`.

Those checks are there to make restores deliberate. They also help when you need to explain to a reviewer that a restore drill cannot quietly point back at production by accident.
