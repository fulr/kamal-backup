Backups for Rails apps deployed with Kamal should not become a separate ops project.

`kamal-backup` is one Kamal accessory that runs encrypted backups for your Rails database and file-backed Active Storage files on a schedule. It also gives you restore drills and redacted evidence for security reviews like CASA.

If you already deploy with Kamal, backups should feel like adding one more accessory.

## Why Rails teams use it

Most self-hosted Rails apps need the same things:

- scheduled backups for PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, or SQLite
- file-backed Active Storage backups from mounted volumes
- a fast way to restore production data locally
- restore drills that do not touch the live production database
- evidence that says more than "the backup job is green"

`kamal-backup` packages that workflow into a small Ruby gem, a production accessory image, and a restic repository.

## Quick start

Add the gem:

```rb
group :development do
  gem "kamal-backup"
end
```

Generate the config file and accessory snippet:

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec kamal-backup init
```

Add the accessory to `config/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
accessories:
  backup:
    image: ghcr.io/crmne/kamal-backup:latest
    host: chatwithwork.com
    files:
      - config/kamal-backup.yml:/app/config/kamal-backup.yml:ro
    env:
      secret:
        - PGPASSWORD
        - RESTIC_PASSWORD
        - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    volumes:
      - "chatwithwork_storage:/data/storage:ro"
      - "chatwithwork_backup_state:/var/lib/kamal-backup"
```

Put the backup settings in `config/kamal-backup.yml`:

```yaml
accessory: backup
app_name: chatwithwork
database_adapter: postgres
database_url: postgres://chatwithwork@chatwithwork-db:5432/chatwithwork_production
backup_paths:
  - /data/storage
restic_repository: s3:https://s3.example.com/chatwithwork-backups
restic_init_if_missing: true
backup_schedule_seconds: 86400
```

Boot it. The container runs `kamal-backup schedule` by default:

```sh
bundle exec kamal-backup validate
bin/kamal accessory boot backup
bin/kamal accessory logs backup
```

Run the first backup and print evidence. From an app checkout with `config/deploy.yml`, these commands shell out through Kamal to the backup accessory:

```sh
bundle exec kamal-backup backup
bundle exec kamal-backup list
bundle exec kamal-backup evidence
```

## What you get

- **Scheduled backups:** the accessory runs continuously and backs up on `backup_schedule_seconds`.
- **Database and Active Storage coverage:** database dumps plus file-backed Active Storage files from mounted volumes.
- **Restic underneath:** encrypted, deduplicated snapshots in S3-compatible storage, a restic REST server, or a filesystem repository.
- **Local restores:** pull production backups into your local Rails app when you need to inspect real data.
- **Restore drills:** restore into scratch production-side targets and record the result.
- **Security review evidence:** `kamal-backup evidence` prints redacted JSON with latest snapshots, checks, drills, retention, and tool versions.
